# Rayst

A toy ray tracer written in Rust.

## Description

This repo contains a ray tracer implemented in a TDD style going through the book [The Ray Tracer Callenge:
A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer][1] by Jamis Buck.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* No dependencies yet. Will likely need to choose a graphics library for rendering.

### Installing

If you have a rust compiler and Cargo installed:

* clone the repository
* cd into the newly created directory and execute:
```
cargo build
```

### Executing program

* after building, execute
```
cargo run
```
* currently this is the default "Hello World" implementation
* it should get more interesting as the project progresses
